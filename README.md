# Farm2U
Farm2U is a platform for local merchants, farmers, and residents that facilitates more efficient and sustainable farmer's markets. Our core mission is to encourage locals to support their nearby markets and to help merchants optimize their stock with analytics and pre-paid sales contracts with individual clients. In doing so, we can help communities reduce food waste while helping people get fresher produce. We also found that one of the biggest issues local farmers face is visibility, so we help bridge the gap between them and their customers, displaying locations and times for local farmer's markets as well as the produce and merchants there for users to preview.
